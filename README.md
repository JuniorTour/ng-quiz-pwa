## PWA Definition

- Progressive - Work for every user, regardless of browser choice because they’re built with progressive enhancement as a core tenant.

- Responsive - Fit any form factor, desktop, mobile, tablet, or whatever is next.
  
-  Connectivity independent - Enhanced with service workers to work offline or on low quality networks.
  
- App-like - Use the app shell model to provide app-style navigations and interactions.
 
- Fresh - Always up-to-date thanks to the service worker update process.
  
 - Safe - Served via TLS to prevent snooping and ensure content hasn’t been tampered with.
  
 - Discoverable - Are identifiable as “applications” thanks to W3C manifests and service worker registration scope allowing search engines to find them.
  
 - Re-engageable - Make re-engagement easy through features like push notifications.
  
 - Installable - Allow users to “keep” apps they find most useful on their home screen without the hassle of an app store.
  
 - Linkable - Easily share via URL and not require complex installation.
